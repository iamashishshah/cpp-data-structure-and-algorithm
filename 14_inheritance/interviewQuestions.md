1. What is the difference between public, private, and protected inheritance?

2. Explain what happens when you delete a base class pointer that points to a derived class object.

3. What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading?
- Method overriding means we're re-defining the method on the other hand method overloading means we've a method with different parameters and return type.

4. What is the purpose of the virtual keyword in inheritance?
- to make an class abstract(that means we're not proving implementation rather saying you've to do when create concrete class of abstract class.)

5. Can you instantiate an object of an abstract class? Why or why not?
- it depend what kind of virtual methods does abstract class is containing: if it is having pure virtual methods then no, else if it is having regular virtual methods then yes. but what when they have mix of both?

6. Explain the concept of multiple inheritance and how to handle ambiguity in C++.

7. What is a pure virtual function, and what happens when a class contains one?
